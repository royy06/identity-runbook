Project 2: Access Requests & Least Privilege Review

## Objective
Demonstrate the principle of least privilege by controlling access using security groups and validating that users only have the permissions they need.

---

## 1. Review Existing Users and Groups

1. Sign in to **Microsoft Entra Admin Center**.
2. Navigate to **Entra ID → Users → Active users**.
3. Identify:
   - Test users created previously
   - Existing security groups
4. Navigate to **Entra ID → Groups** and review current group memberships.

---

## 2. Create Role-Based Security Groups

1. Go to **Entra ID → Groups**.
2. Click **New group**.
3. Configure the group:
   - Group type: **Security**
   - Group name: `App-Access-Users`
   - Description: Users with approved access to the application
4. Save the group.
5. Repeat to create a second group:
   - Group name: `App-Access-Admins`
   - Purpose: Administrative-level access (restricted)

---

## 3. Assign Users Based on Least Privilege

1. Open the **App-Access-Users** group.
2. Add **only one test user** as a member.
3. Leave the second test user unassigned.
4. Do NOT add users to the Admin group unless required.

Purpose:
- Users only receive access needed for their role.
- No default or excessive permissions are granted.

---

## 4. Simulate an Access Request

1. Identify a test user **without group access**.
2. Document an access request scenario:
   - User requests access to application resources.
3. Review the request:
   - Verify business need
   - Confirm correct group assignment
4. Approve the request by adding the user to:
   - `App-Access-Users` group
5. Deny access if not justified.

---

## 5. Validate Access Changes

1. Sign in as the approved test user.
2. Confirm access is now available.
3. Sign in as the unapproved user.
4. Confirm access is denied or unavailable.

---

## 6. Least Privilege Review

1. Review group memberships:
   - Ensure no user has unnecessary access.
2. Confirm:
   - No users are in Admin groups by default.
   - Access is only granted through security groups.
3. Remove any excess permissions found.

---

## 7. Document Access Review Results

Record:
- Which users requested access
- Which users were approved or denied
- Which group provided access
- Any permissions removed during review
