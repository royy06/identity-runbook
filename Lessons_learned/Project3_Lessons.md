## Lessons Learned – Project 3 (MFA Enforcement)

- Enforcing MFA is a simple but powerful way to protect accounts — even strong passwords aren’t enough without it.  
- Testing in a private/incognito browser is important to make sure MFA triggers every time.  
- Understanding the difference between group membership and roles clarified what users can actually access.  
- Simulating risky logins and reviewing sign-in logs showed how easy it is to spot suspicious activity.  
- Always double-check registered MFA methods to ensure the workflow works for all users and no one gets locked out.
