## Lessons Learned – Project 4
- Always verify the user’s identity first to prevent unauthorized access.  
- Communicating securely with the user is just as important as resetting the password.  
- Testing the sign-in after the reset ensures the process actually worked.  
- Documenting each step creates a repeatable process and saves time for future issues.  
- Account lockouts are common, but having a clear workflow makes handling them fast and reliable.
