## Lessons Learned

- I learned how the **Joiner, Mover, Leaver (JML) lifecycle** works and why it’s important to update access when a user changes roles or leaves.  
- I saw how **group memberships control access** and how moving users between groups reflects real-world role changes.  
- I learned how **access reviews** are used to ensure users only have the permissions they need.  
- I realized that **lab or license limitations** can affect hands-on testing, but documenting intended steps and outcomes is still important.  
- Overall, I understand how **identity governance enforces security and compliance** in an organization.
