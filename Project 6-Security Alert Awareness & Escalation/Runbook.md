## Step 1 – Identify Security Alerts

I monitored the security portal to identify triggered alerts and reviewed the alert details to understand the potential risk.  

---

## Step 2 – Investigate Alerts

I analyzed each alert to determine whether it was a true security concern or a false positive. This included checking affected users, devices, and the type of activity flagged.  

---

## Step 3 – Escalate Incidents

For alerts confirmed as incidents, I followed escalation procedures to notify the appropriate security team or administrator.  

---

## Step 4 – Document Findings

I recorded each alert, my investigation results, and any actions taken for escalation.
