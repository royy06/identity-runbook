## Step 1 – Review Incident Scenarios

I reviewed sample incident scenarios to understand which responsibilities fall on Microsoft and which fall on the customer.  

---

## Step 2 – Determine Responsibility

For each scenario, I identified whether Microsoft or the customer is responsible for resolving the issue, providing support, or monitoring the system.  

---

## Step 3 – Document Ownership

I recorded the ownership assignments for each scenario, noting who is accountable for remediation, escalation, and follow-up.  

---

## Step 4 – Review Findings

I verified that each incident scenario had clear ownership and that responsibilities were aligned with Microsoft’s shared responsibility model.
